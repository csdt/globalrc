Hooks are executed with the following order:

*-pre-sync
  pre-sync
*-pre-copy
# copy of the files
*-post-copy
  post-sync
*-post-sync

* is replaced by pull or push according to the script used to sync the conf.
No error is thrown if the hook file does not exist.
Hooks can be any executable file (ex: shell script, python script, binary...)

There are also hooks executed on the sender machine:
  just append sender- at the beggining of the filename
  ex: sender-pre-sync, sender-push-post-copy

The sender hooks are executed in parallel of their analogous hooks on the receiver.

For push: localhost is the sender and the remote host is the receiver.
For pull: localhost is the receiver and the remote host is the sender.

Full order execution for push:
sender-push-pre-sync    # on sender
sender-pre-sync         # on sender
sender-push-pre-copy    # on sender
       push-pre-sync    # on receiver
       pre-sync         # on receiver
       push-pre-copy    # on receiver
# copy of the files
sender-push-post-copy   # on sender
sender-post-sync        # on sender
sender-push-post-sync   # on sender
       push-post-copy   # on receiver
       post-sync        # on receiver
       push-post-sync   # on receiver

Full order execution for pull:
sender-pull-pre-sync    # on sender
sender-pre-sync         # on sender
sender-pull-pre-copy    # on sender
       pull-pre-sync    # on receiver
       pre-sync         # on receiver
       pull-pre-copy    # on receiver
# copy of the files
sender-pull-post-copy   # on sender
sender-post-sync        # on sender
sender-pull-post-sync   # on sender
       pull-post-copy   # on receiver
       post-sync        # on receiver
       pull-post-sync   # on receiver
